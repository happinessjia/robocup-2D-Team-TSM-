1. Basic information about the competition

  + Robocup
  
  
    RoboCup(Robot World Cup) is a robot competition, launched in 1990s. The ultimate goal of the RoboCup  
    Initiative to be stated as follows:  
    
    
    ***"By the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot soccer players shall win  
    a soccer game, complying with the official rules of FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World Cup "***  
    
    
    There are several different kinds of robot soccer competition in RoboCup, including Simulation, Small Size,  
    Middle Size, Standard Platform, Humanoid.

  + robot competition of Zhejiang University
  
  
    Zhejiang University organized the first robot competition in the year of 2005-2006. The competition was  
    organized by the robotics research lab in College of Control Science and Engineering. This competition  
    was focusing on the robocup 2D simulation league, including 7VS7 and 1VS1. That was a simplized competition  
    compared with the formal robocup 2D simulation league.

2. team TSM (Three SwordsMan)

   TSM was one of the teams participating the first robot competition of Zhejiang University. I(Jiajia Zheng) was the team leader. Our teammates were Ming Li and someone who left the team during the preparing time. Our performance was pretty excellent in the competition leaderboard. At last, we got the fourth place and won the first prize in the final official competition. Ming Li and I were joined the robotics research lab after the competition,then preparing for the Robocup China Open 2006.

4. about the source code

   The code in the source_code folder contained all of the *.cpp and *.h of the team TSM in the final competition. However, more than 15 years have passed. The language of C/C++, related libraries and tools have some changes, so it is impossible to compile the souce code and run it directly. The source code only contained the agents. 
Server and moniter are provided by the Robocup Official Organization.

This competition is the start of my robotics career, unforgettable. Thanks for mentors and teammates.
